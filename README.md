# PreDoc - AI powered pre-consultation health assistant

Patients often visit doctors without clear symptom summaries or records. This leads to rushed, incomplete consultations, misdiagnoses, or repeated tests.
Thereâ€™s a gap between self-observed health and what is communicated to the doctor.


> **PreDoc** is a smart pre-consultation app that collects health data from smartwatches and user inputs, uses AI to summarize symptoms, detect concerns, and generate a report to improve doctor consultations.
